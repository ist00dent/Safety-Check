# Content Safety Checker Browser Extension

This is a browser extension I built to help identify potentially harmful or misleading content on social media platforms like Facebook and GitHub.

## Features

The extension adds a "Safety Check" button to posts and comments. When clicked, it analyzes the content for:

-   **Toxicity:** Detects potentially toxic or hateful language.
-   **Emotional Manipulation:** Identifies common tactics used to manipulate emotions (e.g., urgency, fear, guilt, exaggeration).
-   **Sentiment Analysis:** Determines the overall emotional tone of the content (positive, negative, neutral).
-   **Source Credibility:** (Basic check) Analyzes linked URLs to see if they come from a list of trusted news sources.

## How it Works

The extension consists of two main parts:

1.  **Frontend (Browser Extension):** Written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This part runs in your browser, detects posts/comments on supported websites, injects the "Safety Check" button, and sends the content to the backend API for analysis.
2.  **Backend (Flask API):** Written in Python using the Flask framework. This part receives the content from the extension, performs the various safety checks using libraries like `TextBlob`, and returns the analysis results.

## Setup

To use this extension, you need to set up both the backend API and install the extension in your browser.

### 1. Backend Setup

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  Install the required Python packages. It's recommended to use a virtual environment (like `venv`):
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment (if you don't have one)
    python -m venv .venv
    
    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows PowerShell:
    .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On macOS/Linux or Windows Git Bash/WSL:
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  Run the Flask API server:
    ```bash
    python api.py
    ```
    The API should start running on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 2. Frontend Installation (Chrome/Edge)

1.  Open your browser and go to the Extensions page (e.g., `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome or `edge://extensions/` in Edge).
2.  Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle switch in the top right corner.
3.  Click the **Load unpacked** button in the top left corner.
4.  Select the root directory of this project (the folder containing `manifest.json`).
5.  The "Content Safety Checker" extension should now appear in your list of installed extensions.

## Usage

1.  Make sure the backend Flask API is running (`python api.py` in the `backend` directory).
2.  Navigate to a supported website (e.g., Facebook or GitHub).
3.  You should see a "üõ°Ô∏è Safety Check" button appear below posts or comments.
4.  Click the button to perform a content safety analysis. A popup will appear with the results.
5.  Close the popup by clicking the 'x' button.

## Customization

You can customize the extension by modifying the code:

-   **Backend (`backend/api.py`):** Adjust the toxicity word list, emotional manipulation indicators, trusted sources, or add entirely new analysis features.
-   **Frontend (`content.js`):** Modify the selectors to target different elements on supported websites, change the button text or appearance, or alter how the results are displayed.
-   **Styling (`style.css`):** Change the look and feel of the button and the results popup.

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to make this Content Safety Checker even better! Here are some ways you can contribute:
